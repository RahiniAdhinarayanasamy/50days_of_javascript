a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;
console.log(a, b, c)
~~~
2. Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.
~~~
OUTPUT:
var a = 11;
var b = 9;
var c = 3;
// Only change code below this line
a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;
console.log(a, b, c)
~~~
3. Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator.
~~~
OUTPUT:
var a = 5;
var b = 12;
var c = 4.6;
// Only change code below this line
a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
console.log(a, b, c)
~~~
4. Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator.
~~~
OUTPUT:
var a = 48;
var b = 108;
var c = 33;
// Only change code below this line
a /= 12;
b /= 4;
c /= 11;
console.log(a, b, c)
~~~
5. Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.
