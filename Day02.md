1. Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase. Do not create any new variables.
~~~
OUTPUT:
// Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;
// Variable assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
~~~
2. Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20.
~~~
OUTPUT:
var sum = 20 + 0;
~~~
3. Change the 0 so the difference is 12.
~~~
OUTPUT:
var difference = 45 - 33;
console.log(difference)
~~~
4. Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.
~~~
OUTPUT:
var product = 8 * 10;
console.log(product)
~~~
5. Change the 0 so that the quotient is equal to 2.
~~~
OUTPUT:
var quotient = 66 / 33;
console.log(quotient)
~~~
