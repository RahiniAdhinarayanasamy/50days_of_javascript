1. Correct the assignment to myStr so it contains the string value of Hello World using the approach shown in the example above.
~~~
OUTPUT:
// Setup
var myStr = "Jello World";
// Only change code below this line
myStr = "Hello World" 
~~~
2. Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation.
~~~
OUTPUT:
// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";
// Only change code below this line
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2]; // Change this line
console.log(thirdLetterOfLastName)
~~~
3. Use bracket notation to find the last character in the lastName variable
~~~
OUTPUT:
// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";
// Only change code below this line
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length-1]; // Change this line
console.log(lastLetterOfLastName)
~~~
4. Use bracket notation to find the second-to-last character in the lastName string.
~~~
OUTPUT:
// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";
// Only change code below this line
var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2]; // Change this line
console.log(secondToLastLetterOfLastName)
~~~
5. You will need to use the string concatenation operator + to build a new string, using the provided variables: myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, and myAdverb. You will then assign the formed string to the wordBlanks variable. You should not change the words assigned to the variables.
You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final sentence has spaces between all the words. The result should be a complete sentence.
~~~
OUTPUT:
var myNoun = "dog";
var myAdjective = "big";
var myVerb = "ran";
var myAdverb = "quickly";
// Only change code below this line
var wordBlanks = "The " + myAdjective + " " + myNoun + " " + myVerb + " " + myAdverb + "."; // Change this line
// Only change code above this line
console.log(wordBlanks)
~~~
