1. Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.
~~~
OUTPUT:
var myVar = 87;
// Only change code below this line
myVar++;
~~~
2. Change the code to use the -- operator on myVar.
~~~
OUTPUT:
var myVar = 11;
// Only change code below this line
myVar--;
~~~
3. Create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. 5.7).
~~~
OUTPUT:
var myDecimal = 5.7;
~~~
4. Change the 0.0 so that product will equal 5.0.
~~~
OUTPUT:
var product = 5.0 * 1.0;
console.log(product)
~~~
5. Change the 0.0 so that quotient will equal to 2.2.
~~~
OUTPUT:
var quotient = 4.4 / 2.0; // Change this line
